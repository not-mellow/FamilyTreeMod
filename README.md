### 3. How To Save And Load A Family In A World

    - This is very important because once you leave a world that has families, they will not save when you return to the world. In order to prevent that

    you must save and load the families in that world.

    a. To save families, you must first save the world that holds the units with families.

    b. Once you saved the world, go into the Family Tree Mod Tab and search for a button called "Save Families".

    c. Press that button and a message should appear saying "Families Have Been Saved Into A File". If you see a message that is different then you have failed to save

    and must refer back to step a.

    d. Now that you have saved a family, you will now learn how to load the family when you return to your world.

    e. Go to the world that you have saved the families on and go into the Family Tree Mod Tab. Search for the button called "Load Families" and press it.

    f. After pressing it, a message will appear that says "Families Have Been Loaded From Save File". If you see a message that is different then you have failed to load

    the families, either because you didn't save correctly or some other error.

    g. If you got all of that correctly you should be able to save and load families from any world you want.

## Please Take Note:
1. There is a limit of only 15 families available
2. Babies won't show in the family window when they haven't left the house yet.
3. Ghost in a family tree indicate that the unit is dead.
4. Only units that are part of a city or a kingdom can create families.
5. I have disabled children having 2 parents, since it causes confusion(I may re-add this later on though)
